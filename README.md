Interactive Instalment at Viking Museum

This project was made for The Danish Vikingship Museum in Roskilde. 
The assignment was to create an instalment of interaktive objects that would expand upon the museums exhibition.

My role in this project was as a project and creative leader.

I developed this project with Morten, Frederik , Mikkel and Nicolai. 

I lead the project as it was my creative vision we were developing, but I could not have done it without the others. 
This was early in my education and I had not yet aquired the technical skills to pull it off. 

Frederik and Morten developed the code
Nicolai was our lighting technician
Mikkel helped building the physical objects, and also drew up the storyboards according to my instructions.

This link shows me presenting the project at the museum. The video is made by the museum and focuses alot on the discussion of the
objects, their effects and how they work in conjunction with the setting of the museum, but throughout the video all the effects are shown. 


The project includes a drum with sound effect, an anvil + hammer with lighting and sound effects, a vikinghorn with sound effect,
and an executioners block + sword with sound and light effects. 

My vision was that to create a room where the guests could add more and more effects to a storytelling experience that would change
depending on which objects the guests would use. The objects had to relate to the vikings so I wanted the objects and their effects
in combination to give understandable references understandable by most. 

To that effect I chose the anvil that, when struck, would activate the sound of thunder and flash the lights bright. The desired effect
was to create a reference to Thor, the god of thunder. 

The drum would activate the sound of an aggresive drumming rythm to give reference to battles and rituals.

The horn was iconic as both a drinking horn and a Warhorn. I chose to go for the later effect. Pressing a button would activate the
sound of a war horn. Mostly because it would have been problematic to have the guests drink from it or blow into it.

Finnaly the executioners block and sword activated the sound of a sword swing, the sound of a decapitation and turn the lights red, to reference an execution.
